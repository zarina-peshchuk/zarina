### Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I am a quality assurance engineer and I'm looking for a job.
- In August 2021 I have finished an 8 month Test Automation Engineer (Python) course where I tested 2 sites using Postman, 2 sites using Selenium, prepared 4 checklists, and 6 test cases for manual testing. I created a Telegram - bot for exchange rates.
